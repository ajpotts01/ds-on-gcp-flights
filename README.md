Flight data DE/MLE project from Lak's excellent book: Data Science on the Google Cloud Platform (https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/data-science-on/9781098118945/)

#### Please note
This repo is a work in progress as I have spare time to read the book.

A lot of the examples are old and don't work with newer versions of libraries, so I'm adjusting as I can.

I'm basically live-committing debug code, so this repo will be a mess at the best of times, likely until I finish the book and have a chance to clean it all up.
